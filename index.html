          <p>I am Jhon Longsson, a man of many titles. Some of them earned, some of them stolen and some of them bought. Father, husband, boss, mailman, doctor, pilot, director, even lord are a few titles I come by every day. There are plenty of stories behind all of them, all adding a new lens to see all my sides, but I digress. <br><br> Iâ€™m a humble man living a happy life, finding happiness through the little things. Helping people is something that makes my day everyday. That is my ultimate goal. With all my previous experiences, I want to improve the world by helping whoever however I can.</p>

          <h1>Timestuff</h1>
          <p>Timestuff is a website that acts like a dump for my Minecraft data pack projects I want to publish. I update this website manually. I particularly like this website because it's very simplistic. I also like it because it uses accordion menus as an easy way to store and axcess a lot of info without it all cluttering the website. Another part that I'm proud of is the YouTube video. I spent countless hours making that cursed piece of javascript do the correct thing. But it ended up looking catchy.</p>

         <h1>Saucy Server</h1>
          <p>The Saucy Server Website is a web store/news page/business for a Minecraft server a girl nicknamed Saucy ran. That was the intended use of the website anyway. I wanted the website to be a place for the political news of the political movements across the server. I even made a part where all the candidates had a place to display what they stood for. I also wanted the in-game shops to have an opportunity to show what they were selling. The business idea was quite good and would have made me rich. In-game, of course. All my clients were to pay me monthly for a place on the webpage. A day or two after I deployed the first version of the webpage, I heard that two of my friends had been telling everyone that no one should cooperate with me. I left the server a few days later, and the website remains.</p>

         <h1>Teotire</h1>
         <p>Teotire is a project that I hold close to my heart. It's one of the very first deployed websites. The inspiration behind this one is one of my close friends. He had a lot of opinions about controversial and inside-joke things, and I wanted him to have a place to tell the world about what he got on his mind. I consider the website to be of the conspiratorial-article sort, and I have a good laugh about the memories that come when I read the crazy stories he produced.</p>

         <h1>Kolener</h1>
          <p>Kolener is a fun little HTML challenge I set for myself. The challenge aimed to create a sort of search engine template. I went with a darkish design because I simply believe it looks better. I also advocate light mode being a horrible choice for anything that shouldn't look boring. I'm pretty proud of what I made. I think that Google should pay attention to how well everything turned out on the webpage. A detail, however, is that the navigation bar on the top looks tiny. Most of my websites before this one has very small navbars. Otherwise, I believe it's a work of art worthy of all good-looking search engine prizes.</p>
